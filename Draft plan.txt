Main problem- Maze solving program

Considerations:
--> Setting up maze outline
	-References from online existing maze blueprints in python and youtube videos
--> Choice of algorithm - Starting with known ones like Depth First Search, Breadth First Search and A Star algorithm. Will further explore if time permits.
--> Reading papers and using lecture notes and uploaded module material to understand implementation of DFS, BFS and A* mainly.

Plan of action:
1. Create maze outline
2. Implement algorithms
3. Compare for best path and time taken
4. Explore different algorithms
